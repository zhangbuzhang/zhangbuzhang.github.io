I am an Assistant Professor in the College of Computer Science at National University of Defense Technology (NUDT). I teach CS-related courses and conduct research in the field, striving not to be swept away by the fast-paced tech revolution. I have broad research interests in software systems. To be more specific, my goal is to build reliable and efficient software systems by combining traditional methods and intelligent approaches.
